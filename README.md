# BreastCancerData
Analysis on the Breast Cancer - Wisconsin Data Set
I have used Logistic regression for classification
My model is 95% accurate in classifying people with or without breast cancer
I have done K-Fold cross validation and calculated Precision, Recall and F1 Score of our model. 
The model is 97% precise and the Recall is 95% for classifying the people with breast cancer.
I have also identified the best parameters using the Gridsearch
Please go through the Results page for an elaborate view of the results.
